Instead of having a three-dimensional puzzle of cells, we could now
treat it as a linear sequence. The cell lineage is essentially a program
that runs, and we can read it."

you can see every cell. It has exactly 959 somatic cells, and every
animal develops identically. It's eutelic."

Based on the transcript excerpt (§58-59), I propose the following hypothesis
