### H1: Morphogen Gradient Model
Cells determine their fate by reading concentration gradients
of signaling molecules (morphogens) secreted from organizing centers.
- Mechanism: Concentration-dependent transcription factor activation
- Anchors: §58, §78

### H2: Timing Model
Cell fate is determined by intrinsic timing mechanisms that
count cell divisions or developmental stages.
- Mechanism: Sequential gene expression programs
- Anchors: §161

### H3: Third Alternative (Stochastic + Selection)
Initial fate assignment is stochastic, with selection
mechanisms eliminating "incorrect" outcomes.
- Mechanism: Random differentiation + competitive survival
- Anchors: §203
